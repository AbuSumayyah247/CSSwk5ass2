        As a student of knowledge at Stutern, so far I am now familiar with some
        aspects of HTML and a handful part of CSS. Under HTML, I have learnt
        about tags, table, and forms as well as button. In CSS, I have been
        exposed to basic CSS, its hierarchy, methods to link CSS and Specificity
        in CSS. I can not forget to mention how to apply effect different sytle
        on a particular element, class or attribute.
